## catkey guidelines



1. Do not spam. Spamming is the repeated uploading of the same or similar content over and over in which there is no real effort put into the content. Shitposting is okay, just don't spam it over and over again.

2. Do not flood/abuse the drive feature. Do keep in mind that this is my own server and storage that it is using, and it isn't your own free file storage (use Google Drive or something). I will severely limit/take away storage or access to the drive feature altogether if you abuse it.

3. Do not post NSFW or suggestive content with minors or characters of questionable age, including drawn or otherwise fictional content. This shouldn't need any explanation.

4. Do not participate in hate speech or violent extremism. We get it, free speech, yada yada yada. This is still a rule nevertheless.

5. Do not share malware, nobody wants it.

6. Do not promote self-harm or suicide. We don't need or want any of that around here.

7. Do not harass users or evade blocks/bans. I will know, and Cloudflare is not forgiving.
